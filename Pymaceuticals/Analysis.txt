From the regression model, we can see that there is a positive linear relation between 'Weight' and 'Tumor Volume'. But the data is not tightly clustered rather it is loosely clustered, this is a moderate linear relation.

The correlation coefficient shows that there is a strong positive realtion between 'Weight' and 'Tumor Volume' which means as weight increases, tumor volume also increases.
